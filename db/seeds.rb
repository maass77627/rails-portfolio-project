Review.create([
 { :summary => "An improvement in every aspect!", :body => "All too often, I find that sequels just don't provide a worthy follow up to the original or that sometimes the original story is just so incomplete that I hardly have any desire to move forward for fear of never receiving a satisfying conclusion. For this reason, I often stay away from sequels and even series in general, at least in terms of books. I think this is part of the reason it took me so long to pick up Suzanne Collins' CATCHING FIRE (The Hunger Games Book 2) despite having read the original and seen both of the respective movies a long while ago. The CATCHING FIRE movie adaptation was one of the few movie sequels that I ever thought to be drastically better than the previous film in every way possible. That's not to say that it made me like the first any less, just that I felt it had improved in all aspects. And so I went into this book with timid excitement, hoping I would feel the same way.", :rating => 4, :user_id => 3, :book_id => 1},
 { :summary => "This book is super short", :body => "I mean, in terms of actual analyses and content - otherwise it is just a gigantic dictionary for each strength it identifies. You're essentially paying a lot of money for the test and the dictionary. For me, I didn't tell me anything new, and I suppose personally I don't necessarily agree with the author's theories. Anyway, I won't go into that as I think the majority of the 2 star rating I'm giving is due to the surprise that the book is just a dictionary... In which I didn't find any of the terms to be significant or new. If you are someone that does a lot of self-analyses to begin with, I may just pass on this book and look for something more complex / in-depth.", :rating => 2, :user_id => 8, :book_id => 2},

I continued to plod my way through disliking everything about each of the players...surely one or the other would have a redeeming quality. But as we know this would not be the case. If there are these kinds of lunatics out there I am so glad I haven't knowingly come across any. To me, it became ridiculously foolish.

The suffering of veterans of world war 2 and how few of them had the will to live through days of being stranded in the ocean and years being violated as POW has been illustrated in great depths by the author . Great narrative of the live of war hero who didn't give up in spite of unspeakable horror that has bestowed upon him .
